  <h1>Places I have lived</h1>
  <p>
    I was born in Denver. When I was 14 I decided that going to military school would be a great way
    to spend my teenage years, so I went to a military boarding school in Roswell, New Mexico. I was then accepted
    to Virginia Military Institute with a full ride scholarship, so I went there for a brief time (frehsman semester)
    in college. Hated that lifestyle, so I moved back to Denver for a bit. Found the best Middle East history program
    I could get into. Ended up  going to the University of Utah, in Salt Lake. Moved to Sharjah in the UAE for a semester
    abroad, stayed there for a spell. Got an internship in DC, so I stayed there for a while. Back to Utah to finsih up school.
    When I was done in Utah, I moved back to Utah.

<h1>Places I have never lived, but would like to visit</h1>
<p>
  I have been to Jerusalem before, and I loved it. I would like to go back now that I can speak
  Arabic and know <strong>WAY</strong> more history. I would like to go to Seoul and Tokyo because I love
  Korean and Japanese food and would like to spend some time in those places eating everything I could.
